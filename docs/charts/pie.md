# Pie Charts

Pie charts are circular statistical graphics divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportions. Each slice represents a category's contribution to the whole.

## When to Use Pie Charts

Pie charts are ideal for:
- Showing parts of a whole
- Displaying percentage distributions
- Comparing proportions
- Visualizing budget allocations
- Market share analysis

- Label slices directly when possible
- Ensure all slices are clearly visible

## When NOT to Use Pie Charts

- You have many categories (use bar chart instead)
- Values are very similar (hard to compare slice sizes)
- You need precise comparisons
- Showing changes over time
