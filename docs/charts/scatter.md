# Scatter Plots

Scatter plots display data as a collection of points, each representing the values of two variables. They're excellent for identifying relationships, correlations, and patterns between variables.

## When to Use Scatter Plots

Scatter plots are ideal for:
- Showing relationships between two variables
- Identifying correlations (positive, negative, or none)
- Detecting outliers and anomalies
- Visualizing distribution patterns
- Comparing data clusters
- Scientific and statistical analysis

## Creating a Scatter Plot

To create a scatter plot in DataInsight AI:

1. Upload your CSV file with numerical data
2. Select the X-axis variable
3. Select the Y-axis variable
4. Choose "Scatter Plot" from the chart type selector
5. Optionally add a third dimension (color or size)

## Configuration Options

### Point Styling
- Point size and shape
- Color coding by category
- Opacity/transparency
- Custom markers

### Trend Lines
- Linear regression line
- Polynomial fit
- Moving average
- Confidence intervals

### Advanced Features
- Bubble charts (size represents third variable)
- Color gradients for additional dimensions
- Hover tooltips with detailed information
- Zoom and pan capabilities

### Customization
- Axis scales (linear, logarithmic)
- Grid lines
- Reference lines
- Annotations
- Legend configuration

## Best Practices

- Use clear axis labels with units
- Choose appropriate point sizes (not too small or large)
- Add trend lines to show relationships
- Highlight outliers when relevant
- Use color to add categorical information
- Ensure points don't overlap excessively
- Include a reference line (y=x) when comparing similar metrics

## Interpreting Scatter Plots

### Correlation Patterns
- **Positive correlation**: Points trend upward from left to right
- **Negative correlation**: Points trend downward from left to right
- **No correlation**: Points show no clear pattern
- **Non-linear**: Points follow a curved pattern

### Outliers
Points that fall far from the general pattern may indicate:
- Data entry errors
- Special cases worth investigating
- Opportunities or problems

## Example Use Cases

- Height vs. weight relationships
- Advertising spend vs. revenue
- Study time vs. test scores
- Product price vs. sales volume
- Temperature vs. ice cream sales
- Experience vs. salary correlation
- Customer age vs. purchase frequency
