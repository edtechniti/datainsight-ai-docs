# Area Charts

Area charts are similar to line charts but with the area below the line filled with color. They're particularly effective for showing cumulative totals and the magnitude of change over time.

## When to Use Area Charts

Area charts are ideal for:
- Showing trends over time with emphasis on magnitude
- Displaying cumulative data
- Comparing multiple data series (stacked areas)
- Visualizing part-to-whole relationships over time
- Emphasizing the volume or total value

## Creating an Area Chart

To create an area chart in DataInsight AI:

1. Upload your CSV file with time-series data
2. Select your X-axis (typically time or sequence)
3. Select one or more Y-axis columns
4. Choose "Area Chart" from the chart type selector
5. Configure stacking and styling options

## Configuration Options

### Area Styles
- **Standard area**: Single series with filled area
- **Stacked area**: Multiple series stacked on top of each other
- **Overlapping area**: Multiple series with transparency
- **Percentage area**: Shows relative proportions totaling 100%

### Visual Customization
- Fill colors and opacity
- Border line styling
- Gradient fills
- Smooth or stepped areas
- Grid lines and axes

### Multiple Series
- Layer ordering
- Color schemes
- Individual transparency
- Legend positioning

## Best Practices

- Use stacked areas to show part-to-whole relationships
- Apply transparency for overlapping areas
- Choose complementary colors for multiple series
- Avoid too many overlapping series (3-4 maximum)
- Use consistent time intervals
- Start Y-axis at zero for accurate representation
- Consider using percentage stacking for proportion analysis

## Stacked vs. Overlapping

### Stacked Area Charts
- Show cumulative totals
- Display how each category contributes to the whole
- Total is represented by the top line
- Best for part-to-whole relationships

### Overlapping Area Charts
- Compare independent series
- Each series has its own baseline
- Require transparency to see all series
- Best for comparing trends

## Example Use Cases

- Website traffic sources over time
- Revenue streams contribution
- Energy consumption by source
- Population growth by region
- Budget allocation over fiscal years
- Resource utilization over time
- Product sales by category over quarters
- App usage by feature

## Comparison with Line Charts

Use area charts instead of line charts when:
- You want to emphasize the magnitude of change
- Showing cumulative values is important
- Displaying part-to-whole relationships over time
- The volume or total is significant to your story

Use line charts instead when:
- Precise value reading is critical
- You have many series to compare
- The focus is on the trend rather than magnitude
